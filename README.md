# 🧵 Emily’s Closet — A Tailoring Companion for Stardew Valley

> **"Fashion meets farming."**  
> *A fan-made tool to help you visualize what outfits you can make.*

## 🎯 What is this?

**Emily’s Closet** is a web tool that lets *Stardew Valley* players easily:

- 👗 **Discover** what clothing results from combining a specific item with cloth in the sewing machine
- 🧣 **Look up** what item you need to create a specific clothing piece

All in a cute, handcrafted interface — built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

---

## 🌟 Why it’s Special

✨ **No frameworks. No build tools. No fluff.**  
This project is lovingly crafted in **pure web tech**:

```bash
📁 index.html
🖼 assets/
🎨 css/
📜 js/
```

## 💡 Inspiration

This project was born out of frustration — constantly flipping through giant tailoring spreadsheets on the wiki just to:

> *“What can I make with this Duck Feather?”*  
> *“How do I get that cute red vest?”*

Now you can find the answer instantly.
